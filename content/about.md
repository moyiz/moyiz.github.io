Finally, after many years of procrastination and de-prioritising.

The time for shameless monologues is yesterday!

In all seriousness, I have been toying with the idea of building a primitive
website like this. It will most likely (eventually) be centered around toy
projects and hobbies, but I guess that only time will tell.

My motivations for building this site and writing content revolve around the
desire to enhance my technical writing skills, create a well-structured
organization of thoughts and information, and maintain a habit of documenting my
projects and progress.

It is also a great excuse for building a kind of a simple static-site
generation mechanism, although it is almost certain that using an existing
static-site generator would have been a better choice, but would probably be
less fun.

Needless to say, I am not a designer or frontend developer by any means. I would
admit that I tend to favor a simple and straightforward designs. From my
perspective, practicality, customizability, efficiency and simplicity are the
most important aspects of such websites. No paywall, ads, cookies, necessity for
user accounts, animations or resource hogging.

It is highly inspired by various sites and concepts, notably the simplicity of
websites such as [suckless][sl], [LWN][lwn] and [sourcehut][sh], the visual
simplicity and practicality of tiling window managers and some terminal UIs, and
even some points made by the controversial [motherfucking website][mfw], as
every satire hides some valid points in it.
