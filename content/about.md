Finally, after many years of procrastination and de-prioritising.

The time for shameless monologues is yesterday!

In all seriousness, I have been toying with the idea of building a primitive
website like this. It will most likely (eventually) be centered around toy
projects and hobbies.

My motivations for building this site and writing content revolves around few
skills I would like to maintain:

- Technical writing.
- Structural organization of thoughts and information.
- Habit of documenting projects and progress.

It is also a great excuse for building a kind of a simple static-site
generation mechanism.

It is not hard to determine that web UI design is not my trade, and I would
admit that I would prefer a simple and straightforward design in probably all
cases. In my personal perspective- practicality, customizability, efficiency
and simplicity are the most important aspects of such websites. No paywall,
ads, cookies, necessity for user accounts or resource hogging.

It is highly inspired by various sites and concepts, notably the simplicity of
websites such as [suckless][sl], [LWN][lwn] and [sourcehut][sh], the visual
simplicity and practicality of tiling window managers and terminal
multiplexers, and even some points made by the controversial [motherfucking
website][mfw], as every satire hides some valid points in it.
